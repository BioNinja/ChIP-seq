SICER is designed for histone modification domain calling from ChIP- 
Seq. 

We recently released an updated version, SICER v1.1. Some memory- 
consuming issues in the previous version have been solved. 

Regarding parameter settings in SICER, window size is 200 by default 
(to represent single nucleosome resolution). And gap size is usually 1 
- 3 window size, i.e. 200, 400 or 600. For sharp peaks like H3K4me3, 
the gap size doesn't affect much on the results. For broad peaks as 
H3K27me3, H3K9me3 or H3K36me3, we recommend 600 for gap size. 

I usually don't let a gap size more than 5 * window size. Instead, I 
would sacrifice the resolution a little bit by increasing the window 
size to 400 or even 1000, and keep gap size = 3 window size. We've 
used this setting on H3K27me3 and PolII and have got good results. 

SICER has a users google group (http://groups.google.com/group/sicer- 
users) as well. You are welcome to join and your feedbacks are highly 
appreciated!
